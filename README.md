## Priority Matrix

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Importance` Matrix.

### MVP
Working bracket logic and RESTful database structure.
Works for 4 players, best out of 1 game per round.
All running on one page with overlays(modals) used for data entry and collection.

### Post MVP
works for 8 or 16 players, best out of 3/5 games
Visual spice added for tournament progression


## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous game phases section try and breakdown the logic further into functional components, and by that we mean functions.  Does your logic indicate that code could be encapsulated for the purpose of reusablility.  Once a function has been defined it can then be incorporated into a class as a method.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: |
| Game Logic | H | 10hrs| 12hrs |
| Total |  | 33hrs| 26hrs |
